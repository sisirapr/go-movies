### Description

React is the world's most popular JavaScript library for building Single Page Applications, and Go is uniquely well-suited for building REST back ends.
React is an open-source, front end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.
Go is a modern, type safe, compiled, and extremely fast programming language. It it is ideally suited for building safe, scalable, incredibly fast REST APIs and web applications.
Receiving requests on the back end, both as JSON and as GraphQL, and returning that response as JSON.
To secure access to authenticated users for certain parts  of our site, we use JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
